# Adfly-Bot
---
Simple Adfly Clicker Bot. This bot use Electron to handle all the Window/Proxy/Click's and interface.

### How to use
Just drag the Bot folder to the Electron App.

##### NOTE
The bot works with no complication, but the Adfly server can detect if you're using a Proxy, because most of the know proxy's are some how registred on Adfly database or something.

If you have a good proxy list (Elite and Anonymous) you should have no problem. For now you can only open one instance of the bot at time. 

There are a lot of people that belive that after one hour you can click the link(s) again with the same IP(Proxy list).

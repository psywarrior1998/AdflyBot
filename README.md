### How to use
Just drag the Bot folder to the Electron App, there is no dependencies from any other library.

##### NOTE
The bot works with no complication, but the Adfly server can detect if you're using a Proxy, because most of the know proxy's are some how registered on Adfly database or something.

If you have a good proxy list (Elite and Anonymous) you should have no problem. For now you can only open one instance of the bot at time.

There are a lot of people that believe that after one hour you can click the link(s) again with the same IP (or Proxy list).
